# Spotify Machine Learning Project (name tbd)

## Description

This project has **3 main tasks**:<br/>
a) **Gather data** on a user's Spotify listening automatically<br/>
b) **Create a prediction algorithm** based on this data to predict what music that user would want given some data<br/>
c) Use this prediction alogrithm to **create a custom user radio** which responds to how the user interacts with songs to inform future predictions

## Installation & Use

For either option below, the first step is to clone the repository by copying the HTTPS link into the IDE of your choice

### How to Generate a Dataset

1) Run the record.py file. This will redirect you to localhost on your device. Allow my app to access your data.
2) Listen to music & it will automatically be stored in the data.csv file.

**Here is an example dataset graphed:**
![time:valence daily chart d3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fed2504-bdd2-4902-accb-e5821f035b47)
_X-axis is time (seconds passed since midnight). Y-axis is valance (positivity of the music. 1 is the most positive). Colors represent different days of the week._
